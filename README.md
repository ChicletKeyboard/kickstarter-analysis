### Launch Date's Affect on Fundraiser Success
After reviewing 1,369 theatre fundraisers, we were able to find two important trends about how the start date of the fundraiser can affect its' success.
- 1) As you can see in a ![Graph of Theater fundraiser outcomes based on their launch date](/kickstarter-analysis/Resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png), the largest spike in sucessful fundraisers occured in the summer months between May and August.
- 2) 
### Theatre Outcomes Based on Fundraiser Goal
Setting an appropriate goal amount is a key factor. in determining the likeleyhood of a sucessful fundraiser. Looking at one of the largest subsections of fundraisers in the United States, successful kickstarters had an average goal of just over $5,000. This is in stark contrast to the average goal of failed fundraisers was more than double at over $10,550. As you can see in a graph of ![outcomes based on fundraiser goals](/kickstarter-analysis/Resources/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png), the rate of successful fundraisers steadily drops the more that is asked for a fundraiser. To increase the likleyhood of making your fundraing goal, we recommend you to keep your goal under $5,000.
