# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Reason For Analysis
We had been contacted by Louise who recently came close to reaching her fundraising goal *Fever* to analyze other kickstarters and what factors caused them to succeed or fail. She had provided a dataset of thousands of kickstarters that included descriptive data of the events they were fundraising, as well as data on backers. Breaking down the dataset into category and subcategory, dates started/finished, and the fundraiser goal all helped show important trends that gave Lousie a better idea on how to make her next kickstarter campaign a success.

## Analysis
The first step we did in analyzing Louise's provided dataset was to break down the categories into more detailed subcategories so we can better serve her goals. Since she was specifically wanting data similar to her play *Fever*, we broke down the success rate of the ![major categories](/kickstarter-analysis/Resources/Parent_Category_Outcomes.png) and saw that plays were both a common fundraiser, and that plays had the most successes out of any category. We pulled the data of several plays that Louise liked to compare them to her own goals and found that there was little in common with how much was pledged beyond the goal amount and other external factors such as the average donation and number of backers. We found the most discernable trends in fundraiser sucess when breaking down sucessful campaigns by ![when they were created](/kickstarter-analysis/Resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png) and how much was asked for the ![initial goal](/kickstarter-analysis/Resources/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png). The biggest takeaways we wanted Lousie to take into account for her next fundraisers can be found below.

## Results
### Launch Date's Affect on Fundraiser Success
After reviewing 1,369 theatre fundraisers, we were able to find two important trends about how the start date of the fundraiser can affect its' success.
- 1) As you can see in a ![Graph of Theater fundraiser outcomes based on their launch date](/kickstarter-analysis/Resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png), the largest spike in sucessful fundraisers occured in the summer months between May and August.
- 2) After the rise in sucessful theatre fundraisers that launched in the summer, there is a downward trend in the following months concluding in December with nearly as many sucessful fundraisers as failed ones. The trend of more successful fundraisers being launched in the summer compared to the spring and fall months lead us to recommend that *Fever's* fundraiser be launched in May and to avoid launching after August for the highest chance of success.
### Theatre Outcomes Based on Fundraiser Goal
Setting an appropriate goal amount is a key factor. in determining the likeleyhood of a sucessful fundraiser. Looking at one of the largest subsections of fundraisers in the United States, successful kickstarters had an average goal of just over $5,000. This is in stark contrast to the average goal of failed fundraisers was more than double at over $10,550. As shown in the graph for all outcomes based on ![fundraiser goals](/kickstarter-analysis/Resources/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png), the rate of successful fundraisers steadily drops the more that is asked for a fundraiser. To increase the likleyhood of making Louise's fundraing goal, we recommend Louise to keep goal under $5,000.
### Dataset Limitations
As with any analysis, there were limitations to the data Louise provided that made finding meaningful insights more difficult. There were several outliers in the fundraiser goal amounts that were hundreds of thousands of dollars higher than the average fundraiser goals. This may have skewed the data to show the higher-end fundraiser goals were riskier than others. Lousie's lack of provided context may have also hurt the analysis of her provided dataset as we could not determine how she collected or cleaned her data. This could have included her potential biases for or against certain fundraisers. These potential bias may have skewed the data to make play *Fever* just missing its' goal more reasonable than if she included other fundraising data. Data was also only included from 2009-2017, making some trends in the data possibly skewed by outside financial factors such as the 2008-2009 financial crisis affecting consumer spending on kickstarter campaigns. Breaking down the trends into categories based on the global and local economic situations of backers could have helped us to provided a more detailed discussion about howthese macroeconomic factors potential kept *Fever* from being successful. Overal, the lack of context provided by Louise and her unknown ability in creating the dataset we were given has left us with some potentially large gaps in our analysis and recommendations.
