After reviewing 1,369 theatre fundraisers, we were able to find two important trends about how the start date of the fundraiser can affect its' success.
- 1) As you can see in (graph), the largest spike in sucessful theater fundraiser is from those launched in May. 
- 2) 
### Theatre Outcomes Based on Fundraiser Goal
Setting an appropriate goal amount is a key factor. in determining the likeleyhood of a sucessful fundraiser. Looking at one of the largest subsections of fundraisers in the United States, successful kickstarters had an average goal of just over $5,000. This is in stark contrast to the average goal of failed fundraisers was more than double at over $10,550. As you can see in (outcomes graph), the rate of successful fundraisers steadily drops the more that is asked for a fundraiser. To increase the likleyhood of making your fundraing goal, we recommend you to keep your goal under $5,000.
